In these years, there has been little mitigation except the addition of a completely inadequate A/C floor unit.&nbsp; At the best of times, the Iris Studio is a hot, horrible, dirty place for dancing.&nbsp; There is little ventilation.&nbsp; A/C is limited to the floor unit and fans (which our fellow dancers often bring). The room, especially, the floor is generally filthy.&nbsp; We dance barefooted and come away with blackened&nbsp;soles. Last summer, the conditions were so terrible, that all of our classes were held in the rec center.&nbsp; Our spring&nbsp;classes were also scheduled for inside the rec center.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">The Kinesis scheduling for our hula class leaves we class members with difficult choices.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are a close-knit, long-standing group but some of our regular dancers are part of vulnerable&nbsp; population groups or work with them. Ideally, our class should be treated like other Kinesis classes and scheduled into an air-conditioned and hopefully clean space.&nbsp;There are some indications that there will be less general&nbsp;&nbsp;usage of the Iris Studio for dancing.&nbsp; That's nice but the conditions are still pretty inhumane.&nbsp; Hot and miserable with perhaps less exposure&nbsp;versus better conditions but more exposure&nbsp;makes for a hard decision.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">I, with other&nbsp;class&nbsp;members, would like Kinesis would like more clarity to these plans. Is there really going to be cleaning between classes?&nbsp; Who will enforce the other protocols like temperature taking.&nbsp;&nbsp; As agents of the City,&nbsp; Kinesis is responsible for the safety and growth of the Parks and Rec programs.&nbsp; You can bet that&nbsp; Kinesis dancers' parents would never allow their children to dance under hot, unsafe conditions.&nbsp; Sadly, Kinesis has no problems subjecting certain Parks and Rec classes to this.&nbsp; &nbsp;It feels very discriminatory and anti-diversity.&nbsp; &nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">We've already lost a lot of time dancing.&nbsp; For our spring classes, we were given 30-minute, mid-day Zoom classes&nbsp; in place of the hour-long evening classes we paid for and sessions were also missed. Those of us with day jobs found the scheduling difficult.&nbsp; We all understand the current situation but it really seems more like WE are doing the accommodating&nbsp;not Kinesis.&nbsp; &nbsp; It often seems our concerns are glossed over. &nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">We're all trying to NOT feel that is&nbsp;cavalier and commercial for Kinesis to schedule classes Parks and Recs classes the way they do but we do not seem to be well-served.&nbsp; &nbsp;Without more information and assurances, many of us probably won't sign up for class.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">Where do we stand on this?&nbsp; If we complain, are we going to be booted from the program as our teacher fears?&nbsp; I love dancing and my classmates but I want to be safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">Carol Tedrow<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u></p></div></div></blockquote></div></body></html>`,

        `Hi Megann, I appreciate you taking the time to reply to my email. Many of us have had long standing concerns about how the program is administered. You may be interested to note that while you have said all plans are tentative, Kinesis has already sent out emails firmly announcing that classes will start in a week. We are being coerced to sign up immediately as classes will be "limited". We love our class. Hula is a very special dance that we participants take peace and solstice in. I hope something can be done to make the Iris Studio a better place for dancing. Thank you for your efforts.

My classmate, Michelle has shared her communications with Kinesis. It seems like classes can not be restarted without additional guidance from Boulder on COVID-19 issues. That is good as long as we have advance notice and better communication. I have been in this class for five years and the Iris Studio, especially in summer, has always been an on-going issue. In these years, there has been little mitigation except the addition of a completely inadequate A/C floor unit. At the best of times, the Iris Studio is a hot, horrible, dirty place for dancing. There is little ventilation. A/C is limited to the floor unit and fans (which our fellow dancers often bring). The room, especially, the floor is generally filthy. We dance barefooted and come away with blackened soles. Last summer, the conditions were so terrible, that all of our classes were held in the rec center. Our spring classes were also scheduled for inside the rec center. The Kinesis scheduling for our hula class leaves we class members with difficult choices. We are a close-knit, long-standing group but some of our regular dancers are part of vulnerable population groups or work with them. Ideally, our class should be treated like other Kinesis classes and scheduled into an air-conditioned and hopefully clean space. There are some indications that there will be less general usage of the Iris Studio for dancing. That's nice but the conditions are still pretty inhumane. Hot and miserable with perhaps less exposure versus better conditions but more exposure makes for a hard decision. I, with other class members, would like Kinesis would like more clarity to these plans. Is there really going to be cleaning between classes? Who will enforce the other protocols like temperature taking. As agents of the City, Kinesis is responsible for the safety and growth of the Parks and Rec programs. You can bet that Kinesis dancers' parents would never allow their children to dance under hot, unsafe conditions. Sadly, Kinesis has no problems subjecting certain Parks and Rec classes to this. It feels very discriminatory and anti-diversity. We've already lost a lot of time dancing. For our spring classes, we were given 30-minute, mid-day Zoom classes in place of the hour-long evening classes we paid for and sessions were also missed. Those of us with day jobs found the scheduling difficult. We all understand the current situation but it really seems more like WE are doing the accommodating not Kinesis. It often seems our concerns are glossed over. We're all trying to NOT feel that is cavalier and commercial for Kinesis to schedule classes Parks and Recs classes the way they do but we do not seem to be well-served. Without more information and assurances, many of us probably won't sign up for class. Where do we stand on this? If we complain, are we going to be booted from the program as our teacher fears? I love dancing and my classmates but I want to be safe. Carol Tedrow`,
